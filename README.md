# Hi, I'm Mirza ðŸ‘‹

Software engineer building tools for grounded AI development.

## ðŸ—¼ Featured Project: Cognition CLI

### Event-driven architecture for verifiable AI cognition over codebases

[ðŸ“š Documentation](https://mirzahusadzic.github.io/cogx/) | [ðŸ’» Repository](https://github.com/mirzahusadzic/cogx)

Cognition CLI implements a novel approach to AI-assisted development through the **Grounded Context Pool (PGC)** â€” a verifiable, content-addressable knowledge graph that grounds AI reasoning in cryptographic truth.

### Key Innovations

- **Monument 1-3**: Event-driven coherence system with <10ms status checks
- **Zero-hallucination analysis**: AI reasoning backed by verifiable PGC data
- **Real-time feedback loop**: `watch â†’ dirty_state â†’ status â†’ update â†’ coherent`
- **Claude Code integration**: 6+ custom slash commands for impact-aware development
- **Battle-tested**: Analyzed 3,636+ symbols across real-world TypeScript projects

### Tech Stack

TypeScript â€¢ Node.js â€¢ AST Parsing â€¢ Vector Embeddings â€¢ LanceDB â€¢ VitePress
