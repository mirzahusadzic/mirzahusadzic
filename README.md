### CogX: Verifiable AI Reasoning Over Codebases

[📚 Documentation](https://mirzahusadzic.github.io/cogx/) | [💻 Repository](https://github.com/mirzahusadzic/cogx) | [📄 Prior Art Publication](https://github.com/mirzahusadzic/cogx/blob/main/DEFENSIVE_PUBLICATION.md)

**CogX** is an architectural blueprint for verifiable AI-human symbiosis built on a formal mathematical truth: **Knowledge IS a lattice**.

Every act of reasoning reduces to two primitive operations—**Meet (∧): finding common ground** and **Join (∨): building higher understanding**. The Grounded Context Pool (PGC) is the first executable implementation of this formal theory, providing cryptographically verifiable, persistent memory that enables AI systems to augment, rather than replace, human intelligence.

### The Architecture

**Dual-Lattice System:**

- **Project Lattice (PGC)**: Content-addressable knowledge graph with 7-dimensional overlays (Structure, Security, Lineage, Mission, Operational, Mathematical, Coherence)
- **Conversation Lattice (Σ)**: Real-time conversation indexing with intelligent compression, enabling infinite context across unlimited sessions

**Mathematical Foundation:**

- Every dependency query is a **Meet (∧)** operation traversing to common ancestors
- Every synthesis is a **Join (∨)** operation building higher abstractions
- Knowledge compounds through lattice algebra: `O1 ∩ O2`, `O4 ~ "verification"`

**The Goal:** Accelerate human progress by providing mathematical foundations for AI systems that augment human intelligence with cryptographically verified, persistent understanding.

The **COGNITION Σ CLI** provides interactive access to this architecture through a production-ready terminal interface.

### 🚀 Getting Started

CogX requires thoughtful onboarding to build the knowledge graph for your project. The setup involves code analysis, embedding generation, and overlay construction.
