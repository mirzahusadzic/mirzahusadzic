## 🚀 Featured Work: Open Cognition

### CogX: Verifiable AI Reasoning Over Codebases

[📚 Documentation](https://mirzahusadzic.github.io/cogx/) | [💻 Repository](https://github.com/mirzahusadzic/cogx) | [📄 Prior Art Publication](https://github.com/mirzahusadzic/cogx/blob/main/DEFENSIVE_PUBLICATION.md)

A breakthrough system for grounded AI development through the **Grounded Context Pool (PGC)** — a verifiable, content-addressable knowledge graph that eliminates AI hallucinations through cryptographic verification.

### 🏆 Recent Achievements

**🎉 [v1.5.2 Released](https://github.com/mirzahusadzic/cogx/releases/tag/v1.5.2)** — Visual Color Theology & Context Sampling Function ([DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17453691](https://zenodo.org/records/17453691))

**October 26, 2025** — Breakthrough: Recursive Meta-Cognition & Mission Security Layer:

- ✅ **O₃ Layer (Mission Concepts)**: Pattern-based extraction with 6 targeted strategies (97.6% noise reduction: 1,076 → 26 concepts)
- ✅ **O₄ Layer (Strategic Coherence)**: Vector similarity scoring between code and strategic documents
- ✅ **Recursive Meta-Cognition**: System extracted its own methodology documentation as concepts
- ✅ **Semantic Drift Detection**: Immutable versioning with embedding-based distance calculation (cosine distance on concept centroids)
- ✅ **5-Pattern Attack Detection**: Security weakening, trust erosion, permission creep, ambiguity injection, velocity over safety
- ✅ **Multi-Layer Mission Security**: Gemini LLM validation + pattern matching + semantic drift detection
- ✅ **DocsOracle**: Content-addressable document validation with garbage collection
- ✅ **Markdown Parser with Meta Props**: Hierarchical AST with structuralHash, position tracking
- ✅ **Overlay Invalidation**: Auto-detect document changes and cascade to dependent overlays

**October 24-25, 2025** — First documented case of AI performing architecture analysis using only structured metadata:

- ✅ **Meta-Cognitive Analysis**: cognition-cli successfully analyzed its own architecture
- ✅ **Zero Source File Reading**: Complete architectural understanding from .cogx metadata alone
- ✅ **100% Reproducible**: 101 structural patterns analyzed with verifiable commands
- ✅ **Defensive Publication**: Established prior art for Open Cognition innovations (AGPLv3)

**Impact**: Achieved the "docs is code, code is docs" vision through recursive extraction. The system can now learn from its own documentation and protect itself from gradual mission poisoning through multi-layer semantic drift detection.
