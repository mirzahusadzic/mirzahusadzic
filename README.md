## 🚀 Featured Work: Open Cognition

### CogX: Verifiable AI Reasoning Over Codebases

[📚 Documentation](https://mirzahusadzic.github.io/cogx/) | [💻 Repository](https://github.com/mirzahusadzic/cogx) | [📄 Prior Art Publication](https://github.com/mirzahusadzic/cogx/blob/main/DEFENSIVE_PUBLICATION.md)

A breakthrough system for grounded AI development through the **Grounded Context Pool (PGC)** — a verifiable, content-addressable knowledge graph that eliminates AI hallucinations through cryptographic verification.

### 🏆 Recent Achievements

**October 24-25, 2025** — First documented case of AI performing architecture analysis using only structured metadata:

- ✅ **Meta-Cognitive Analysis**: cognition-cli successfully analyzed its own architecture
- ✅ **Zero Source File Reading**: Complete architectural understanding from .cogx metadata alone
- ✅ **100% Reproducible**: 101 structural patterns analyzed with verifiable commands
- ✅ **Defensive Publication**: Established prior art for Open Cognition innovations (AGPLv3)

**Impact**: Proved that verifiable, grounded AI cognition is not just theory—it's working in production.

### 🔬 Innovations Disclosed as Prior Art

These innovations are protected from patent restrictions and remain free for all humanity:

**Foundation (Innovations #1-10):**

- **Mathematical Foundation**: Knowledge representation as a lattice structure
- **Goal→Transform→Oracle Pattern**: Universal pattern for verifiable AI transformations
- **Grounded Context Pool (PGC)**: Content-addressable knowledge storage system
- **Structural Mining Pipeline**: Multi-tier code understanding (AST → SLM → LLM)
- **Overlay System**: Multi-dimensional knowledge layers with vector embeddings
- **Meta-Cognitive Self-Analysis**: System analyzing its own architecture
- **The .cogx File Format**: Portable cognitive symbols
- **Cognitive Proof of Work (CPoW)**: Monetizable verified intelligence
- **Event-Driven Coherence System**: Real-time PGC synchronization
- **Claude Code Integration Protocol**: Grounded AI-assisted development

**Security & Provenance (Innovations #11-12):**

- **The Historian Pattern**: O(1) provenance lookup via reverse_deps → transforms
- **Self-Defending Lattice**: Mathematical resistance to adversarial overlays

**Strategic Intelligence (Innovations #13-15):**

- **Documentation as Knowledge Layer**: Markdown AST → content-addressable PGC objects
- **Strategic Coherence Overlay**: Semantic alignment scoring between code and mission
- **Mission-Aware Impact Analysis**: Near-realtime AI fine-tuning (1-3s) for strategic reasoning

### 💡 Tech Stack

- **Core:** TypeScript • Node.js • LanceDB • Git-inspired Storage
- **Parsing:** Native AST • eGemma (Python) • SLM/LLM fallbacks
- **AI Integration:** Vector Embeddings • Claude Code Protocol
