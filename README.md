## 🚀 Featured Work: Open Cognition

### CogX: Verifiable AI Reasoning Over Codebases

[📚 Documentation](https://mirzahusadzic.github.io/cogx/) | [💻 Repository](https://github.com/mirzahusadzic/cogx) | [📄 Prior Art Publication](https://github.com/mirzahusadzic/cogx/blob/main/DEFENSIVE_PUBLICATION.md)

A breakthrough system for grounded AI development through the **Grounded Context Pool (PGC)** — a verifiable, content-addressable knowledge graph that eliminates AI hallucinations through cryptographic verification.

### 🏆 Recent Achievements

**October 24-25, 2025** — First documented case of AI performing architecture analysis using only structured metadata:

- ✅ **Meta-Cognitive Analysis**: cognition-cli successfully analyzed its own architecture
- ✅ **Zero Source File Reading**: Complete architectural understanding from .cogx metadata alone
- ✅ **100% Reproducible**: 101 structural patterns analyzed with verifiable commands
- ✅ **Defensive Publication**: Established prior art for Open Cognition innovations (AGPLv3)

**Impact**: Proved that verifiable, grounded AI cognition is not just theory—it's working in production.

### 🔬 Key Innovations

- **Goal→Transform→Oracle Pattern**: Universal pattern for verifiable AI transformations
- **Grounded Context Pool (PGC)**: Content-addressable knowledge storage with O(1) reverse dependency lookups
- **Structural Mining Pipeline**: Multi-tier code understanding (AST → SLM → LLM) with fidelity scoring
- **Overlay System**: Multi-dimensional knowledge layers with vector embeddings
- **Event-Driven Coherence**: Real-time PGC synchronization with <10ms status checks
- **The .cogx File Format**: Portable cognitive symbols for shareable intelligence

### 💡 Tech Stack

TypeScript • Node.js • AST Parsing • Vector Embeddings • LanceDB • Git-inspired Storage • Claude Code Integration

## 🌍 Open Source Philosophy

All innovations in Open Cognition are published under **AGPLv3** and disclosed as **defensive prior art** to ensure they remain free for all humanity. No entity may patent these innovations.

> _"Every claim is verifiable, reproducible, and backed by cryptographic truth."_
